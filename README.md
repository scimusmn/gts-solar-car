Solar car for Gateway to Science. Component 1004

Exhibit consists of a small plastic solar car kit that drives in circles within a cabinet.
A halogen light is aimed by visitors at the car to make the car move.

An arduino (metro mini) controls a circle of Neopixel RBG LEDs around the track to create a virtual pace car to race against.
It also determines when the race is over and uses a motor to reset the solar car back to the starting line.
